        <h2>Diet For Covid-19 Positive</h2>
        <p>
          The main diet focus for COVID patients is to consume foods that would
          help rebuild muscle, immunity and energy levels. Whole grains like
          ragi, oats or amaranth are rich sources of complex carbohydrates.
          Chicken, fish, eggs, paneer, soya, nuts and seeds are some good
          sources of protein. Healthy fats like walnuts, almonds, olive oil,
          mustard oil are recommended during these days. To boost oneâ€™s
          immunity, one should take turmeric milk once a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Five serving of all coloured fruits and vegetables are a must to get
          adequate vitamins and minerals when you are COVID positive. You can
          have small amounts of dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa which can
          lift your mood, get rid of anxiety and will also boost your immunity.
        </p>
